    <p>
        BSc in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Aberystwyth University, first-class honours. Concurrent to my studies I have created the Computer Science department’s Discord server for which I am also an administrator. The server has over 800 members including lecturers, alumni, staff and students. I developed this community of people, which previously did not exist, and is now an essential part of the department’s online presence. This server acts as a central hub for announcements from the department and a place for people to discuss a multitude of topics ranging from coding to cooking. In addition, I created a small sub‑community of this server where I collaborate with other students to develop Discord bots. I have spent the last three years working as a paid Demonstrator for the department of computer science, a student representative and a Computer Science Advisor, a role that is usually only given to Masters’ students.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time, I create Discord bots in Python, teach myself to write websites using Node.js, self‑host websites, APIs and other services that I run off a Raspberry Pi. I am very familiar with Windows 10 as it has been my main OS that I have used since release, however, I am also very familiar with macOS and Linux.
    </p>
        Over the summer of 2020, I co‑developed a Discord bot for the department of Computer Science to act as a service that helps with demonstrating. The department then hired me to continue to maintain the service for the staff and students, performing updates and helping the staff set up the service themselves. There were times where the service would fail in the middle of the day and I would work very well under pressure to fix the bugs that it produced and bring it back online.
    </p> 
    <p>    
        I work well under pressure and in a team environment due to the group project that I completed in my second year to develop a Java‑based translation app for English to Welsh.
    </p>
    <p> 
        I am an enthusiastic, self‑motivated and innovative person. I enjoy public speaking and working as a team leader. As a bonus, I also speak fluent Italian as I was born in Italy to British parents and lived there until 2018.
